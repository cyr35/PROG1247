        <p>Peruda was the son of José del Carmen Reyes, a railway worker, and Rosa Basoalto.
            His mother died within a month of his birth, and two years later the family moved to Temuco,
            a small town farther south in Chile, where his father remarried. Neruda was a precocious boy
             who began to write poetry at age 10. His father tried to discourage him from writing and never 
             cared for his poems, which was probably why the young poet began to publish under the pseudonym 
             Pablo Neruda, which he was legally to adopt in 1946. He entered the Temuco Boys’ School in 1910 
             and finished his secondary schooling there in 1920. Tall, shy, and lonely, Neruda read voraciously 
             and was encouraged by the principal of the Temuco Girls’ School, Gabriela Mistral, a gifted poet 
             who would herself later become a Nobel laureate</p>
        <p>Neruda first published his poems in the local newspapers and later in magazines published in the 
            Chilean capital, Santiago. In 1921 he moved to Santiago to continue his studies and become a French teacher. 
            There he experienced loneliness and hunger and took up a bohemian lifestyle. His first book of poems, Crepusculario, 
            was published in 1923. The poems, subtle and elegant, were in the tradition of Symbolist poetry, or rather its Hispanic version, 
            Modernismo. His second book, Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada (1924; Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair), 
            was inspired by an unhappy love affair. It became an instant success and is still one of Neruda’s most popular books. 
            The verse in Twenty Love Poems is vigorous, poignant, and direct, yet subtle and very original in its imagery and metaphors. 
            The poems express young, passionate, unhappy love perhaps better than any book of poetry in the long Romantic tradition.</p>
